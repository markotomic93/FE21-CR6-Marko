Task description In this CodeReview, you have to create a travel agency web application using Angular.

GUI guideline note: You can create your own HTML/CSS theme (or with Bootstrap).

You need to create at least three pages Home, Blog and Travels (you are free to create additional pages if you have time and inspiration). Home and Blog should have a static content.

Please examine the designs below as a suggestion:

Home, blog and any other page with static content can have this kind of design. Feel free to provide your content for the Content section:

The travel page should show the different travel destinations with their content in cards (using bootstrap or CSS).

Submission Guidelines:

Submission guideline note: Standard submission procedure should be used, which includes: Creation of a GitHub project (repository name FE21-CR6-Name), “push” to the repository and provide the information to CodeFactory through the learning management system (https://lms.codefactory.live/) with the GitHub link for the cloning procedure.

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(05 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR6-Name.

Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Add codefactorygit as a collaborator and assure your repository is set to private. See an example of a GitHub link below:

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git

(10) Implement theme design, or design similar to the screenshots above.

(20) Your project must contain at least 5 components that together should build up your project.

(20) Use routing to move between the pages. E.g.: your navbar contains 3 navigation links: Home, Blog and Travels. When you click Home you should see the content of the homepage. When you click Blog you should see the content for the Blog page and the Travels page will show all travel offers.

(15) Each travel offer should display the following details: destination, description, start date(s), duration and price.

(20) Create the functionality that when you click on a travel offer in the travel section, it will be added to your cart.

(10) Display the shopping cart in a separate component (for example in a different page that you can access through the navbar).

Bonus Points:

(10) Display the final sum of all the offers the users have selected (i.e Total costs).

(10) If the total sum is more than EUR 200, the user gets a 10% discount. If the total sum is more than EUR 500, they get a 20% discount.
